# A portfolio template for Web Developers
## Check it out at: https://erick-pavani.github.io/Portfolio-Template/
This project was made using this guide: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJE-ze4TfXc&list=PLlLZjJa-d5WglcsNc2Y_t9PQklmz3QB4j&index=4&t=7281s. All credits to him. He has a nice youtube channel that helps web developers with a lot of cool content. Check him out at: https://www.youtube.com/c/CrypticalCoder.

It was very helpful to learn some modern css and javascript techniques used by a experienced developer when making a project like this.
The portfolio is fully interactive and responsive. Fell free to use it!
